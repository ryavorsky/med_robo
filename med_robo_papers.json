        "abstract": "    In the current dynamic business environment, healthcare organizations are focused on improving patient satisfaction, performance, and efficiency. The healthcare industry is considered a complex system that is highly reliant of new technologies to support clinical as well as business processes. Robotics is one of such technologies that is considered to have the potential to increase efficiency in a wide range of clinical services. Although the use of robotics in healthcare is at the early stages of adoption, some studies have shown the capacity of this technology to improve precision, accessibility through less invasive procedures, and reduction of human error during complex surgeries. Additionally, experts have anticipated an increase in the use of robots for tasks that require physical strength, and also tasks that are repetitive, unsafe or that might be contagious. Several studies reported cost savings as a result of using clinical robots. Although robotics shows promise to reduce healthcare cost, the current hospital systems are still not using them in large scale. The application of robotics in healthcare constitutes a problem of integration of new technology in an existing and highly regulated complex system. This paper will present a classification of robots based on their role in a healthcare facility and identify the key factors that affect the integration of robotics in healthcare by applying a prior technology integration framework.

Pertinent to regulatory approvals is the field of Human Factors, which plays a central role in the design of safe and efficient medical devices. This study briefly introduces the FDA regulatory approval process, discusses the role of human factors in the design process and highlights specific robotic systems that have obtained approval for clinical use.

Restricted by the diameter of the surgical trocar through which they are inserted, current clinical stereo endoscopes have a fixed baseline of 5.5 mm. To overcome this restriction, we propose using a stereoscopic \"pickup\" camera with a side-firing design that allows for larger baselines. We conducted a user study with baselines of 10 mm, 15 mm, 20 mm, and 30 mm to evaluate the effect of increasing baseline on depth perception when used with the da Vinci surgical system. Subjects (N=28) were recruited and asked to rank differently sized poles, mounted at a distance of 200 mm from the cameras, according to their increasing order of height when viewed under different baseline conditions. The results showed that subjects performed better as the baseline was increased with the best performance at a 20 mm baseline. This preliminary proof-of-concept study shows that there is opportunity to improve depth perception in robot-assisted surgical systems with a change in endoscope design philosophy. In this paper, we present this change with our side-firing \"pickup\" camera and its flexible baseline design. Ultimately, this serves as the first step towards an adaptive baseline camera design that maximizes depth perception in surgery.      ",

Such a complex procedure may greatly benefit from robotic assistance in order to make the intubation safer and more efficient. We developed the first device to provide such assistance, the REALITI, which stands for Robotic Endoscope Automated via Laryngeal Imaging for Tracheal Intubation. This device allies the automated detection of key anatomical features in an endoscopic image to the robotic steering toward the recognized features in the task of guiding the tracheal tube into its correct position. The pre-clinical prototype presented in this paper has been developed to perform in vitro tracheal inbutation on a standard airway management training manikin. We performed a robust detection of anatomical features to steer the endoscope in a visual servoing fashion. Our prototype has been successfully used to perform automated and manual insertions into the trachea of an airway manikin.    ",

        "abstract": "    The orthopedic manipulation “bone drilling” is the most executed one in the orthopedic surgery concerning the operative treatment of bone fractures. The drilling process is characterized by a number of input and output parameters. The most important input parameters are the feed rate [mm/s] and the drill speed [rpm]. They play significant role for the final result (the output parameters): thermal and mechanical damages of the bone tissue as well as hole quality. During the manual drilling these parameters are controlled by the surgeon on the base of his practical skills. But the optimal results of the manipulations can be assured only when the input parameters are under control during an automatic execution of the drilling process. This work presents the functional characteristics of the handheld robotized system ODRO (Orthopedic Drilling Robot) for automatic bone drilling. Some experimental results are also shown. A comparison is made between the similar systems which are known in the literature, some of which are available on the market. The application areas of ODRO in the orthopedic surgery practice are underlined.    ",

We utilize an automatically formulated knowledge representation from web-based knowledge bases paired with a traversal algorithm to achieve these objectives.

Current training approaches rely heavily on virtual reality simulators, in particular for basic psychomotor and visuomotor skill development. It is not clear, however, whether training in virtual reality is equivalent to inanimate model training. In this manuscript, we seek to compare virtual reality training to inanimate model training, with regard to skill learning and skill transfer. Using a custom-developed needle-driving training task with inanimate and virtual analogs, we investigated the extent to which N=18 participants improved their skill on a given platform post-training, and transferred that skill to the opposite platform. Results indicate that the two approaches are not equivalent, with more salient skill transfer after inanimate training than virtual training. These findings support the claim that training with real physical models is the gold standard, and suggest more inanimate model training be incorporated into training curricula for early psychomotor skill development.

Some of the advances have included robotic hip surgery, image-guided endoscopic surgery, and the use of intra-operative MRI to assist in neurosurgery. However, most of the work in the literature assumes that all of the expert surgeons are physically present close to the location of a surgery. A new direction that is now worth investigating is assisting in performing surgeries remotely. As a first step in this direction, this chapter presents a system that can detect movement of hands and fingers, and thereby detect gestures, which can be used to control a catheter remotely. Our development is aimed at performing remote endovascular surgery by controlling the movement of a catheter through blood vessels. Our hand movement detection is facilitated by sensors, like LEAP, which can track the position of fingertips and the palm. In order to make the system robust to occlusions, we have improved the implementation by optimally integrating the input from two different sensors. Following this step, we identify high-level gestures, like push and turn, to enable remote catheter movements. To simulate a realistic environment we have fabricated a flexible endovascular mold, and also a phantom of the abdominal region with the endovascular mold integrated inside. A mechanical device that can remotely control a catheter based on movement primitives extracted from gestures has been built. Experimental results are shown demonstrating the accuracy of the system.    ",

To guarantee the highest possible safety standards, the best approach is to devise a deterministic automaton that performs identically for each operation. Clearly, such approach inevitably fails to adapt itself to changing environments or different human companions. In a surgical scenario, the highest variability happens for the timing of different actions performed within the same phases. This paper presents a cognitive control architecture that uses a multi-modal neural network trained on a cooperative task performed by human surgeons and produces an action segmentation that provides the required timing for actions while maintaining full phase execution control via a deterministic Supervisory Controller and full execution safety by a velocity-constrained Model-Predictive Controller.

Theoretically, active knee-ankle prostheses may better support natural gait than their passive counterparts by replacing the missing muscle function. The control algorithms of such active devices need to comprehend the user's locomotive intention and convert them into control commands for actuating the prosthesis. For an active knee-ankle prosthesis, the gait variables to be controlled to allow the desired locomotion could be the knee angle, knee moment, ankle angle, ankle moment. In this paper, a random forest regression model is employed for the continuous prediction of these gait variables for level ground walking at self-selected normal speed. Experimentally obtained thigh kinematics were the input to the random forest model. The proposed method could predict the angles and moments of the knee and ankle with high accuracy (mean R2 value of 0.97 for ankle angle, 0.98 for ankle moment, 0.99 for knee angle, 0.95 for knee moment across four able-bodied subjects). The proposed strategy shows potential for continuously controlling an active knee-ankle prosthesis for transfemoral amputees, whose thigh angular motion can be used to infer the required prosthetic moments or angles    ",

Submillimeter scale resolution of MR images for soft tissues combined with the electromagnetic gradient coil–based magnetic actuation available inside MR scanners can enable theranostic applications of medical robots for precise image-guided minimally invasive interventions. MRI-driven robotics typically does not introduce new MRI instrumentation for actuation but instead focuses on converting already available instrumentation for robotic purposes. To use the advantages of this technology, various medical devices such as untethered mobile magnetic robots and tethered active catheters have been designed to be powered magnetically inside MRI systems. Herein, the state-of-the-art progress, challenges, and future directions of MRI-driven medical robotic systems are reviewed.      ",

As a result, research in this field has focused on (a) enhancing the quality and safety of the physical interaction between disabled users and robotic systems while providing a high level of intelligence and adaptability for generating assistive and therapeutic force fields; (b) detecting the user’s motor intention with high spatiotemporal resolution to provide bidirectional human–machine interfacing; (c) promoting mental engagement through designing multimodal interactive interfaces and various sensory manipulation strategies.

        "abstract": "    The rise of healthcare robotics    Robotics have increased productivity and resource efficiency in the industrial and retail sectors, and now there is an emerging interest in realizing a comparable transformation in healthcare. Robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) are some of the latest promising technologies expected to increase the quality and safety of care while simultaneously restraining expenditure and, recently, reducing human contact too. Healthcare robots are likely to be deployed at an unprecedented rate due to their reduced cost and increasing capabilities such as carrying out medical interventions, supporting biomedical research and clinical practice, conducting therapy with children, or keeping the elderly company.    The lack of healthcare robot policy    Although healthcare is a remarkably sensitive domain of application, and systems that exert direct control over the world can cause harm in a way that humans cannot necessarily correct or oversee, it is still unclear whether and how healthcare robots are currently regulated or should be regulated. Existing regulations are primarily unprepared to provide guidance for such a rapidly evolving field and accommodate devices that rely on machine learning and AI. Moreover, the field of healthcare robotics is very rich and extensive, butit is still very much scattered and unclear in terms of definitions, medical and technical classifications, product characteristics, purpose, and intended use. As a result, these devices often navigate between the medical device regulation or other non-medical norms, such as the ISO personal care standard. Before regulating the field of healthcare robots, it is therefore essential to map the major state-of-the-art developments in healthcare robotics, their capabilities and applications, and the challenges we face as a result of their integration within the healthcare environment.    Our contribution to the policy making debate on healthcare robots and AI technologies    This contribution fills in this gap and lack of clarity currently experienced within healthcare robotics and its governance by providing a structured overview of and further elaboration on the main categories now established, their intended purpose, use, and main characteristics. We explicitly focus on surgical, assistive, and service robots to rightfully match the definition of healthcare as the organized provision of medical care to individuals, including efforts to maintain, treat, or restore physical, mental, or emotional well-being. We complement these findings with policy recommendations to help policymakers unravel an optimal regulatory framing for healthcare robot technologies.    ",

While increasingly configurable robotic arms can maximize reach and avoid collisions in cluttered environments, positioning them appropriately during surgery is complicated because safety regulations prevent automatic driving. We propose a head-mounted display (HMD) based augmented reality (AR) system designed to guide optimal surgical arm set up. The staff equipped with HMD aligns the robot with its planned virtual counterpart. In this user-centric setting, the main challenge is the perspective ambiguities hindering such collaborative robotic solution. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel registration concept for intuitive alignment of AR content to its physical counterpart by providing a multi-view AR experience via reflective-AR displays that simultaneously show the augmentations from multiple viewpoints. Using this system, users can visualize different perspectives while actively adjusting the pose to determine the registration transformation that most closely superimposes the virtual onto the real. The experimental results demonstrate improvement in the interactive alignment a virtual and real robot when using a reflective-AR display. We also present measurements from configuring a robotic manipulator in a simulated trocar placement surgery using the AR guidance methodology.      ",

        "abstract": "    Lung cancer is the most common cancer globally with over 2 million new cases diagnosed every year. Fortunately, if caught early, the likelihood of survival is greatly improved. If diagnosed in Stage I, survival rates are > 75 percent over 5 years, vs. just 1 percent if diagnosed in Stage IV. Early diagnosis requires finding and sampling (biopsy) small, peripheral nodules that are located in the parenchima of the lung and predominately outside small airways. Currently, for early diagnosis a bronchoscope is inserted into the lung airway but due to large size it cannot reach the small airways. Therefore, the doctor has to advance a sharp biopsy needle blindly from the tip of the bronchoscope and into the lung tissue in the approximate direction of the nodule. This blind procedure has low accuracy and carries a high risk of misdiagnosis. Currently, to improve the accuracy, real time x-ray (fluoroscopy) is use which causes exposure of the patient and physician to harmful radiation. Computer and image assisted surgery and medical robotics present viable solutions but are not optimal at present. The scope of our research was to develop a robotic solution for increased precision and accuracy of early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, to increase procedure success rate, decrease patient radiation and stress exposure, and reduce the procedure cost. For this purpose, we developed an advanced prototype of a robotic system which is small in size, easy to use and effective. To demonstrate its effectiveness in navigating to peripheral small size lung cancer lesions, we performed laboratory tests or a realistic lung airway model. The preliminary tests of a novel medical robot using a complex lung airway model proved that our catheter driving robotic system is working as designed and allows navigation, through a complex 3D channels structure like the bronchial tree, in both manipulator and robotic modes without fluoroscopy scanning. The robotic system is more precise and stable, and can avoid patient injury and instrument damage due to accidental impact with the airway wall. Because it could be controlled from a different room via the software platform, using this robotic system can drastically reduce radiation exposure of the patient and totally avoid the exposure of the doctor. Another benefit of the proposed robotic system is that it uses currently available catheters in which a reusable electromagnetic guide wire is temporarily inserted to guide the tip of the catheter towards hard to reach targets. After the target is confirmed, the sensor can be retracted and the catheter can be used for its routine function such as biopsy collection. Future development will include placement of a force sensor at the tip of the catheter to “feel” the wall and adapt the speed of insertion in order to avoid wall damage and an improved algorithm to increase the speed in the automatic mode.

The medical image information matching fusion is to obtain two images of a certain range of the patient’s body by two cameras on the robot, and after matching fusion processing, an image is obtained. At present, surgical robots have been successfully applied in minimally invasive surgery such as pelvic organ prolapse, defects and other basin basement reconstruction operations. Previously, most of the robots used in medical surgery have only one arm, but with the development of robotics related fields, multi-fingered robots with binocular stereo vision become possible in completing complex minimally invasive surgery. This paper aims to promote the further integration of multi-fingered manipulator and medical image detection, focusing on the grasping probability of multi-fingered manipulator. When the three-dimensional information of the object is incomplete, the machine learning method performs better than the hard coding method in the object grasping point planning. At present, most known methods can obtain classification results but could not give the probability of this category. Aiming at the problem of grab point planning, this paper proposes a crawling planning method based on big data Gaussian process classification. In this paper, a planner based on Gaussian process classification is designed, and the hyper constant used in the Gaussian process to judge the probability of capture is calculated. Based on the determined crawling scheme, the feasibility distribution map of the grab points which obtained by the trained Gaussian process classifier is drawn in MATLAB. The results show that the trained Gaussian process classifier is biased towards the center of the object which is the point with high stability. This method can give classification results and corresponding probabilities, which represents the feasibility of grasping points.    ",

        "abstract": "    Robots have been put to use in many fields mostly for automation or areas where a great degree of precision is required. Robots can be of huge assistance in medical field too, as they can relieve the patient or the medical personnel from routine and mundane tasks, which may sometime be very crucial and may need to be performed with utmost care, accuracy and precision. The use of robotics is already there in healthcare, but it's not main-stream yet and it would take some time for that to become a reality. The main goal of this research paper would be to shed some light on the same. I have proposed some ideas on how robotics can be used in some niche in healthcare, and how it can be made easy to spread and implement on the ground level. Focus on the need of robotics in healthcare, along with their added advantages in the quality of healthcare and the savings in long time costs would be there. With this, the future of healthcare i.e. Telemedicine would become a reality and it would be a lot easier and cheaper for people to get access to quality healthcare, anywhere in the world with physically attending the hospital.

        "abstract": "    One of the major factors that affect the acceptance of robots in Human-Robot Interaction applications is the type of voice with which they interact with humans. The robot’s voice can be used to express empathy, which is an affective response of the robot to the human user. In this study, the aim is to find out if social robots with empathetic voice are acceptable for users in healthcare applications. A pilot study using an empathetic voice spoken by a voice actor was conducted. Only prosody in speech is used to express empathy here, without any visual cues. Also, the emotions needed for an empathetic voice are identified. It was found that the emotions needed are not only the stronger primary emotions, but also the nuanced secondary emotions. These emotions are then synthesised using prosody modelling. A second study, replicating the pilot test is conducted using the synthesised voices to investigate if empathy is perceived from the synthetic voice as well. This paper reports the modelling and synthesises of an empathetic voice, and experimentally shows that people prefer empathetic voice for healthcare robots. The results can be further used to develop empathetic social robots, that can improve people’s acceptance of social robots.    ",

Since there are no vaccines or any proven medical treatment available, there is an urgent need to take necessary steps to prevent the spread of this virus. As the virus spreads with human-to-human interaction, lockdown has been declared in many countries, and the public is advised to observe social distancing strictly. Robots can undertake human-like activities and can be gainfully programmed to replace some of the human interactions. Through this paper, we identify and propose the introduction of robots to take up this challenge in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. We did a comprehensive review of the literature to identify robots’ possible applications in the management of epidemics and pandemics of this nature. We have reviewed the available literature through the search engines of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and Research Gate. A comprehensive review of the literature identified different types of robots being used in the medical field. We could find several vital applications of robots in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. No doubt technology comes with a cost. In this paper, we identified how different types of robots are used gainfully to deliver medicine, food, and other essential items to COVID-19 patients who are under quarantine. Therefore, there is extensive scope for customising robots to undertake hazardous and repetitive jobs with precision and reliability.    ",

Robots offer the potential to provide healthcare support to patients both at home and in healthcare settings. However, in order for robots to be successfully implemented in these environments, they need to behave in ways that are appropriate and acceptable to human users. One way to identify appropriate social behaviours for healthcare robots is to model their behaviour on interactions between healthcare professionals and patients. This literature review aimed to inform healthcare robotics research by highlighting communication behaviours that are important within the context of healthcare. The review focussed on relevant research in human clinical interactions, followed by a review of similar factors in social robotics research. Three databases were searched for terms relating to healthcare professional communication behaviours associated with patient outcomes. The results identified key communication behaviours that can convey clinical empathy, including humour, self-disclosure, facial expressions, eye gaze, body posture, and gestures. A further search was conducted to identify research examining these key behaviours within the context of social and healthcare robotics. Research into these factors in human–robot interaction in healthcare is limited to date, and this review provides a useful guide for future research.    ",

Video data in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) have enabled opportunities for vision-based artificial intelligence (AI) systems to improve surgical skills training and assurance through post-operative video analysis and development of real-time computer-assisted interventions (CAI). Despite the availability of mounted cameras for the operating room (OR), similar capabilities are much more complex to develop for recording open surgery procedures, which has resulted in a shortage of exemplar video-based training materials. In this paper, we present a potential solution to record open surgical procedures using head-mounted cameras. Recorded videos were anonymised to remove patient and staff identifiable information using a machine learning algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art results on the OR Face dataset. We then propose a CNN-LSTM-based model to automatically segment videos into different surgical phases, which has never been previously demonstrated in open procedures. The redacted videos, along with the automatically predicted phases, are then available for surgeons and their teams for post-operative review and analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the feasibility of deploying camera recording systems and developing machine learning-based workflow analysis solutions for open surgery, particularly in orthopaedics.

To ensure that no injury occurs when the surgeon is manipulating the instrument, the incision point must be a remote center of motion (RCM) for the instrument. For this purpose, a novel target admittance model is designed in the joint space for hands-on procedures that can be applied in all commercially available general-purpose manipulators with six or more degrees of freedom. It is proved that the joint reference trajectories generated by the proposed target admittance model under the exertion of a human force are stable and satisfy the RCM constraint. The measurements of the human force and the robot’s forward kinematic model are only required. Its use spans all hands-on surgical procedures. The proposed model can be easily extended to achieve additional objectives. Simulation results validate the theoretical findings and experimental results utilizing a KUKA LWR4+ demonstrate that trocar displacements are less than 1mm.    ",

The operating room environment specifically is a setting with rich data sources compatible with computational approaches and high potential for direct patient benefit. The aim of this review is to summarize major topics in computer vision for surgical domains. The major capabilities of computer vision are described as an aid to surgical teams to improve performance and contribute to enhanced patient safety. Literature was identified through leading experts in the fields of surgery, computational analysis and modeling in medicine, and computer vision in healthcare. The literature supports the application of computer vision principles to surgery. Potential applications within surgery include operating room vigilance, endoscopic vigilance, and individual and team-wide behavioral analysis. To advance the field, we recommend collecting and publishing carefully annotated datasets. Doing so will enable the surgery community to collectively define well-specified common objectives for automated systems, spur academic research, mobilize industry, and provide benchmarks with which we can track progress. Leveraging computer vision approaches through interdisciplinary collaboration and advanced approaches to data acquisition, modeling, interpretation, and integration promises a powerful impact on patient safety, public health, and financial costs.

While there are no known pharmacological treatments for many of these conditions, behavioral treatments such as cognitive training can prolong the independence of people with cognitive impairments. These treatments teach metacognitive strategies to compensate for memory difficulties in their everyday lives. Personalizing these treatments to suit the preferences and goals of an individual is critical to improving their engagement and sustainment, as well as maximizing the treatment’s effectiveness. Robots have great potential to facilitate these training regimens and support people with cognitive impairments, their caregivers, and clinicians. This article examines how robots can adapt their behavior to be personalized to an individual in the context of cognitive neurorehabilitation. We provide an overview of existing robots being used to support neurorehabilitation, and identify key principles to working in this space. We then examine state-of-the-art technical approaches to enabling longitudinal behavioral adaptation. To conclude, we discuss our recent work on enabling social robots to automatically adapt their behavior and explore open challenges for longitudinal behavior adaptation.

During surgery, precise navigation of surgical instruments supports surgeons and allows prevention of adverse events. Here, an augmented reality-based navigation aid with automated segmentation of risk structures and path planning is presented. Superimposed patient models are visualized during neurosurgical interventions on the example of the ventricular puncture. The proposed system is experimentally validated in a realistic operating room scenario with expert neurosurgeons to determine its quality of support as well as its potential for clinical translation. The automated segmentation reaches a F1-Score of 95-99 percent. Paths are planned correctly in 93.4 percent. The entire process enables navigation aid in under five minutes. Validation shows that the system allows for a puncture success rate of 81.7 percent with mean accuracy of 4.8 ± 2.5 mm. A control group who performed the standard-of-care procedure reached a rate of 71.7 percent with 6.5 ± 2.4 mm accuracy. Acceptability analysis shows that 85.7 percent of the participating surgeons approve of the system’s convenience and 92.9 percent expect accuracy improvement. The presented navigation aid for ventricular puncture enables automated surgical planning and may improve accuracy and success rates of neurosurgical interventions.    ",

Mimicking anatomical structure or appearance of human hand does not lead to improved neural connectivity to the sensorimotor system of amputees. The functions of modern prosthetic hands do not match the dexterity of human hand due primarily to lack of sensory awareness and compliant actuation. Lately, progress in restoring sensory feedback has marked a significant step forward in improving neural continuity of sensory information from prosthetic hands to amputees. However, little effort has been made to replicate the compliant property of biological muscle when actuating prosthetic hands. Furthermore, a full-fledged biorealistic approach to designing prosthetic hands has not been contemplated in neuroprosthetic research. In this perspective article, we advance a novel view that a prosthetic hand can be integrated harmoniously with amputees only if neural compatibility to the sensorimotor system is achieved. Our ongoing research supports that the next-generation prosthetic hand must incorporate biologically realistic actuation, sensing, and reflex functions in order to fully attain neural compatibility.

Therefore, the key is to develop interfaces that optimize attachment stiffness, i.e., reduce relative motion, without compromising comfort. To that end, we propose a method to obtain the optimal attachment pressure in terms of connection stiffness and comfort. The method is based on a soft robotic interface capable of actively controlling strapping pressure which is coupled to a cobot. Hereby the effects of strapping pressure on energetic losses, connection stiffness, and perceived comfort are analyzed. Results indicate a trade-off between connection stiffness and perceived comfort for this type of interface. An optimal strapping pressure was found in the 50 to 80 mmHg range. Connection stiffness was found to increase linearly over a pressure range from 0 mmHg (stiffness of 1139 N/m) to 100 mmHg (stiffness of 2232 N/m). And energetic losses were reduced by 42 percent by increasing connection stiffness. This research highlights the importance of strapping pressure when attaching an exoskeleton to a human and introduces a new adaptive interface to improve the coupling from an exoskeleton to an individual    ",

With the introduction of this technique, the operator can perform multiple steps of endovascular interventions outside of the radiation field with high precision movements even from long-geographical distances.    Areas covered    The first and second-generation CorPath systems are currently the only commercially available robotic devices for endovascular surgery. This review article discusses the clinical experiences and outcomes with the robot, the advanced navigational features, and the results with recent hardware and software modifications, which enables the use of the system for neurovascular interventions, and long-distance interventional procedures.    Expert opinion    A high procedural success was achieved with the CorPath robotic systems in coronary and peripheral interventions, and the device seems promising in neurovascular procedures. More experience is needed with robotic neurovascular interventions and with complex peripheral arterial cases. In the future, long-distance endovascular surgery can potentially transform the management and treatment of acute myocardial infarction and stroke, with making endovascular care more accessible for patients in remote areas.

The research on new Multi-Robots Surgery (MRS) platform is cardinal to the development of a new SARAS surgical robotic platform, which aims at carrying out autonomously the assistants tasks during R-MIS procedures. In this work, we will present the SARAS MRS platform validation protocol, framed in order to assess: (i) its technical performances in purely dexterity exercises, and (ii) its functional performances. The results obtained show a prototype able to put the users in the condition of accomplishing the tasks requested (both dexterity- and surgical-related), even with reasonably lower performances respect to the industrial standard. The main aspects on which further improvements are needed result to be the stability of the end effectors, the depth perception and the vision systems, to be enriched with dedicated virtual fixtures. The SARAS' aim is to reduce the main surgeon's workload through the automation of assistive tasks which would benefit both surgeons and patients by facilitating the surgery and reducing the operation time.

The method is based on the assumption that a surgical robot operators’ skill or a patient’s motor skill is encoded into the innate reward function during motion planning and recovered by an IRL algorithm from motion demonstrations. This class of applications is characterized by high-dimensional sensory data, which is computationally prohibitive for most existing IRL algorithms. We propose a novel function approximation framework and reformulate the Bellman optimality equation to handle high-dimensional state spaces efficiently. We compare different function approximators in simulated environments, and adopt a deep neural network as the function approximator. The technique is applied to evaluating human patients with spinal cord injuries under spinal stimulation, and the skill levels of surgical robot operators. The results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.    ",

A plethora of studies focused on the accuracy of pedicle fixation in robotic-assisted (RA) technology. However, it is not clear whether RA techniques can improve patients' clinical outcomes.    Methods    We retrieved relevant studies that compare the differences between RA and freehand (FH) techniques in spine surgeries from the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. The perioperative outcomes of this technology were measured with parameters including radiation exposure, operative time, the length of hospital stay, complication rates and revision rates. Two reviewers independently reviewed the studies in our sample, assessed their validity and extracted relevant data.    Conclusions    This study suggests that RA spine surgeries would result in fewer complications, a lower revision rate and shorter length of hospital stay. As the technology continues to evolve, we may expect more applications of robotic systems in spine surgeries.    ",

To address this issue, we propose a flexible transoral robot with a teleoperated configuration for swab sampling. The robot comprises a flexible manipulator, an endoscope with a monitor, and a master device. A 3- prismatic-universal (3-PU) flexible parallel mechanism with 3 degrees of freedom (DOF) is used to realize the manipulator’s movements. The flexibility of the manipulator improves the safety of testees. Besides, the master device is similar to the manipulator in structure. It is easy to use for operators. Under the guidance of the vision from the endoscope, the surgeon can operate the master device to control the swab’s motion attached to the manipulator for sampling. In this paper, the robotic system, the workspace, and the operation procedure are described in detail. The tongue depressor, which is used to prevent the tongue’s interference during the sampling, is also tested. The accuracy of the manipulator under visual guidance is validated intuitively. Finally, the experiment on a human phantom is conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the robot preliminarily.    ",

While microstructuring both the electrodes and dielectrics has been proven to have a significant improvement in the sensitivity and response speed of piezocapacitive sensors, the synergetic influence of microstructured electrodes and dielectrics has not been discussed yet. Herein, a flexible piezocapacitive sensor has been demonstrated with a microstructured graphene nanowalls (GNWs) electrode and a conformally microstructured dielectric layer that consists of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and piezoelectric enhancer of zinc oxide (ZnO). Such microstructured assembly with piezoelectric film constructs a microconformal GNWs/PDMS/ZnO electrode-dielectric integration (MEDI), which can effectively enhance the sensitivity and the pressure-response range. The piezocapacitive sensor exhibits an ultra-high sensitivity (22.3 kPa-1), fast response speed (25 ms), and broad pressure range (22 kPa). The finite element analysis indicates that the polarized electric field caused by the ZnO film’s piezoelectric effect greatly enhances the capacitance of the sensor. Moreover, the integration of the electrode and dielectric layer can eliminate the slippage between contiguous layers, which effectively increases the mechanical stability. Benefitting from the outstanding comprehensive performance, the potential application in robotic tactile perception has been successfully demonstrated, including object grabbing, braille recognition, and roughness detection. The MEDI in structure capacitive sensors provides a new approach to achieve high-performance E-skin, which delivers great potential applications in nextgeneration robotic tactile sensing.    ",

Imaging resolution of fiducial markers attached to the needle guide tubing was enhanced by reconstructing a high-resolution image from multiple images with sub-pixel movements of the robot. The parallel-plane direct-drive needle positioning mechanism positioned the needle guide with a high spatial precision that is two orders of magnitude higher than typical MRI resolution up to 1 mm.

Moving from 3G, 4G and 5G, one to the next generation, it includes in-built improvements in various characteristics. The world is collecting traditional information this is huge and providing the same to every corner of the world that creates huge pressure on the core networking and backhaul resources. This paper focuses on combining 5G technologies with mobile edge computing for robotic telesurgery. A huge amount of data is required to continuously transfer over the high-speed network for this process. This process demands high network bandwidth, minimal information loss, minimal delay and real-time response for precise surgery. As of today, useful and cost-effective solutions for medical domain telerobotic surgeries are not preferred yet may be due to the performance limitations of existing communication technologies like 4G. Hence, realtime medical video transmission using 5G enabled tactile (T5ET) internet technology environment is experimented in this research, with a focus on QoS parameters like jitter control, throughput, and delay. Promising results are observed in the evaluation and discussed here which will prominently contribute to the medical domain.    ",

        "abstract": "    This article assessed how surgical robot parameters influenced operator viewpoint during a simulated surgical procedure. Surgical robots are useful tools in minimally invasive surgery. However, even with robots, suturing is difficult because the needle is sometimes obscured by tissue or manipulators and is thus not always visible during the procedure. This is especially true in pediatric surgery, where the surgical environment is smaller than in adult surgery. Hence, surgeons must carefully track the instruments and tissues to understand and predict their current and expected situations. In this article, we used gaze-tracking techniques to analyze the location and timing of the gaze of participants while they manipulated a virtual robotic surgical simulation system. To differentiate between the ideal and actual viewpoint trajectories, we conducted experiments with and without obstacles (i.e., simulated tissue and the manipulator arm). In the obstacle condition, we modulated the wrist length of the manipulator to bring it into view. In the no-obstacle condition, the participants mostly watched the suture needle tip. In the with-obstacle condition, the participants spent less time watching the instruments and more time watching the target point. The amount of time spent watching the target point increased as wrist length increased. Given this trade off relationship, we examined the proportion of time the participants spent looking at the instruments or target points by wrist length. We calculated the Pareto solutions and clarified the relationship between wrist length and the watching parts.    ",

        "abstract": "    Purpose: Expectations for remote surgery in endovascular treatments are increasing. We conducted the world's first remote catheter surgery experiment using an endovascular treatment-supported robot. We considered the results, examined the issues, and suggested countermeasures for practical use.    Methods: The slave robot in the angiography room is an original machine that enables sensing feedback by using an originally developed insertion force-measuring device, which detects the pressure stress on the vessel wall and alerts the operator using an audible scale. The master side was set in a separate room. They were connected via HTTP communication using local area network system. The surgeon operated by looking at a personal computer monitor that shared an angiography monitor. The slave robot catheterized and inserted a coil for an aneurysm in the silicon blood vessel model in the angiography room.    Results: Our robot responded to the surgeon's operations promptly and to the joystick's swift movements quite accurately. The surgeon could control the stress to the model vessels using various actions, because the operator could hear the sound from the insertion force. However, the robot required a time gradient to reach a stable advanced speed at the time of the initial movement, and experienced a slight time lag.    Conclusion: Our remote operation appeared to be sufficiently feasible to perform the surgery safely. This system seems extremely promising for preventing viral infection and radiation exposure to medical staff. It will also enable medical professionals to operate in remote areas and create a ubiquitous medical environment.    ",

We next provide a synthesis of future challenges and considerations in the development and application of healthcare robots. We organize these considerations using a socio-ecological perspective and discuss considerations at the individual, care partner, community healthcare, and healthcare policy levels.    Recent Findings    Older adults are the fastest growing segment of the US population. Age-related changes and challenges can present difficulties, for older adults want to age healthily and maintain independence. Technology, specifically healthcare robots, has potential to provide health supports to older adults. These supports span widely across the physical, cognitive, and social aspects of healthy aging.    Summary    Our review suggests that while healthcare robotics has potential to revolutionize the way in which older adults manage their health, there are many challenges such as clinical effectiveness, technology acceptance, health informatics, and healthcare policy and ethics. Addressing these challenges at all levels of the healthcare system will help ensure that healthcare robotics promote healthy aging and are applied safely, effectively, and reliably.    ",

We achieved excellent comprehensive performance indices through a novel multi-objective optimization model comprising four optimization objective functions, three constrained conditions and two optimization variables. In order to enhance the manipulability, remove the coupling between motors, and reduce the control difficulty, two new decoupling mechanism means were proposed to remove coupling motion between the wrist and pincers, coupling motion between the translational joint of mobile platform and four interface disks of surgical instrument as a results of rear drive motor, respectively. The control system architecture is designed to include intuitive motion control, incremental motion control, and proportional motion control. Master-slave attitude registration and surgical instrument replacement strategies improve the master-slave control efficiency. We tested the spherical RCM mechanism performance indices and developed two mechanical decoupling methods and a master-slave control algorithm. Our experimental test results validated that fixing point accuracy, the coupling motions, the positioning and repeated positioning accuracy of the MIS robot, and master-slave control algorithm meet the requirements of MIS. Successful animal experiments confirmed effectiveness of the novel MIS robot system.    ",

These surgical devices are designed to navigate anatomical pathways via single-port access, such as natural orifices or minimal incisions and intraluminal interventions.

This rehabilitation system was demonstrated in 10 able-bodied experimental participants. Defining a successful exercise repetition as a fully completed exercise, from start point to end point followed by a return to start point, when FES onset is triggered by the EMG threshold, the results showed that 97 percent of the exercise repetitions were successful for a leg press exercise and 100 percent for a dorsiflexion exercise. Furthermore, an FES stimulation current amplitude of 20–53 mA was required for the leg press exercise and 10–30 mA for the dorsiflexion exercise.     ",

        "abstract": "    Europe is well placed to benefit from the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It produces industrial and professional service robots for healthcare and plays an important role in developing and using software applications for companies. Surprisingly, the African Region and Thailand, neither of which is traditionally associated with robotics technology, are making good progress in the use and development of robots in the field of medical service and healthcare by promoting investment in robotics innovation. However, there are still several unclear aspects to be addressed by policymakers in these two regions. Although medical robots have shown great potential in these two areas by contributing to various healing processes, many limitations to the application of the technology as such have emerged in terms of economic policy, legal frameworks, the risk to privacy, and moral responsibility. Apparently, the main barrier holding back these two communities from being the next generation of automotive developers in medical robots is that legislative and investment policies governing robot activities are produced and enforced by different organizations separately. This effectively discourages not only management policy but also related action to support robotics innovation. Even though experts are creating increasingly advanced robot technology, regulation of its development is still lagging behind. This article will inform the social sciences, ethics, law, and market policy to find a solution where robots and humans can work side by side, with an emphasize on the application of legal and economic regulations relating to this growth in automation to encourage the status of the robots, bringing them to the forefront of the socio-scientific platform by applying documentary and action research methodology. In order to achieve this goal, economic policymakers and legal regulators have to engage in these agendas together with producers to establish how law and market policy should react to medical robots appropriately.

So, healthcare in the digital era is experimenting with adopting robotics to provide personal healthcare to patients in need. In this chapter, the needs of elderly patients are identified and solutions are provided with a personalized robot. Emergency situations can also be predicted more quickly with the vital information provided by IoT devices and necessary action can be suggested using artificial intelligence. IoT-based wearable devices are used to obtain necessary health data from patients. These data are processed and decision-making is carried out by AI, whereas the required action is taken by the designed robot. Humanoid robots can be designed for providing healthcare and physical assistance to elderly patients and those with chronic conditions. Animal-like robots can also be designed that act like pets as a solution for those with psychosocial issues. The major goal is to review robots to develop a robot in the future that can prevent interventions, perform multiple functions, provide motivational interaction style, provide better educational data, and alert an ambulance in case of an emergency.

In any such system, there is the task of translating the surgeon’s requests into the process of automated procedure execution. The hardware and software system that provides the translation is the interface between the surgeon and the robot. This paper proposes a generalized framework architecture for the development of such software — the surgeon–robot interface. Existing implementations of such an interface are considered, solutions for the internal structure design of the framework are proposed. Experiments were performed using a prototype of the proposed framework. Such a development framework will allow one to effectively implement the surgeon–robot interfaces at all stages of the robotization of medical procedures, from prototype to final use in the operating room.

No other scientific field grants as much hope in the determination of life and death and fastest-pace innovation potential with economically highest profit margin prospects as does medical care.    An expert survey conducted in November 2019 identified big data-driven knowledge generation and tailored personal medical care but also efficiency, precision and better quality work as most beneficial advancements of AI, robotics and big data in the healthcare sector. Decentralized preventive healthcare and telemedicine open access to personalized, affordable healthcare.    Technical advancements and big data insights – at the same time – increase costs for a whole-roundedly healthy lifestyle. Particularly in Western Europe, the currently tipping demographic pyramid coupled with obstacles to integrate migrants long-term to rejuvenate the population and boost economic output impose challenges for policy makers and insurance practitioners alike. Studies in the US found that 70 percent of all health related costs are accrued during the last few weeks of peoples’ living. In Austria, healthcare cost are expected to double in this decade. This predicament of rising costs of an aging Western world population, raises questions such as – Should we decrease the access to the best quality medical care of Austrian in order to maintain the pursuit of a mandate of medical care for all – or should we allow a different-tiered class-based medical system, in which money determines who can afford excellent healthcare? There must be a better solution for a country like Austria in the heart of the European continent that may stem from a Moving Forward thinking community as we all represent together today.    ",

In the workshop, key technologies as well as future views in the field will be discussed both by expert and new upcoming researchers.    ",

Moreover, situations of this kind are historically cyclical. The symptoms and treatment of infected patients are, for better or worse even for new viruses, always the same: more or less severe flu symptoms, isolation and full hygiene. By now man has learned how to manage epidemic situations, but deaths and negative effects continue to occur. What about technology? What effect has the actual technological progress we have achieved? In this review, we wonder about the role of robotics in the fight against COVID. It presents the analysis of scientific articles, industrial initiatives and project calls for applications from March to now highlighting how much robotics was ready to face this situation, what is expected from robots and what remains to do.    Results    The analysis was made by focusing on what research groups offer as a means of support for therapies and prevention actions. We then reported some remarks on what we think is the state of maturity of robotics in dealing with situations like COVID-19.    ",

To fill this gap, we have developed metrics for surgical skill evaluation that are based on the orientation of surgical instruments. We tested our new metrics on two datasets with different conditions: (1) a dataset of experienced robotic surgeons and nonmedical users performing needle-driving on a dry lab model, and (2) a small dataset of suturing movements performed by surgeons training on a porcine model. We evaluated the performance of our new metrics (angular displacement and the rate of orientation change) alongside the performances of classical metrics (task time and path length). We calculated each metric on different segments of the movement. Our results highlighted the importance of segmentation rather than calculating the metrics on the entire movement. Our new metric, the rate of orientation change, showed statistically significant differences between experienced surgeons and nonmedical users / novice surgeons, which were consistent with the classical task time metric. The rate of orientation change captures technical aspects that are taught during surgeons’ training, and together with classical metrics can lead to a more comprehensive discrimination of skills.

Tracking of human joint motion is challenging in many applications, such as in sport motion analyses. In orthopaedic surgery, these challenges are even more prevalent, where small errors may cause iatrogenic damage in patients - highlighting the need for robust and precise joint and instrument tracking methods. In this study, we present a novel kinematic modelling approach to track any anatomical points on the femur and / or tibia by exploiting optical tracking measurements combined with a priori computed tomography information. The framework supports simultaneous tracking of anatomical positions, from which we calculate the pose of the leg (joint angles and translations of both the hip and knee joints) and of each of the surgical instruments. Experimental validation on cadaveric data shows that our method is capable of measuring these anatomical regions with sub-millimetre accuracy, with a maximum joint angle uncertainty of ±0.47°. This study is a fundamental step in robotic orthopaedic research, which can be used as a ground-truth for future research such as automating leg manipulation in orthopaedic procedures.    ",

This work presents asymmetric bimanual control of a dual-arm serial robot with two remote centers of motion (RCMs) constraints for MIS. In our previous works, general null space controllers to guarantee the fixed RCM constraint have been proposed. However, an incision on a patient’s abdominal wall is not fixed owing to the respiration of the patient, which generates an uncertain disturbance at the joints of robotic manipulators. To improve accuracy, a radial basis function neural network is implemented to adapt to these disturbances and control the end-effector position. Finally, the adaptive bimanual control strategy is validated through simulations based on clinical data. The proposed control shows improved accuracy in the end effector position for all the designed surgical tasks. In future works, the algorithm will be validated on an actual dual-arm serial robot making use of a body phantom.    ",

However, the repetitive manual blood removal involves plenty of workload contributing fatigue of surgeons. Thus, it is valuable to design a robotic system which can automatically remove blood on the incision surface. Methods: In this paper, we design a robotic system to fulfill the surgical task of the blood removal. The system consists of a pair of dual cameras, a 6-DoF robotic arm, an aspirator whose handle is fixed to a robotic arm, and a pump connected to the aspirator. Further, a path-planning algorithm is designed to generate a path, which the aspirator tip should follow to remove blood. Results: In a group of simulating bleeding experiments on ex vivo porcine tissue, the contour of the blood region is detected, and the reconstructed spatial coordinates of the detected blood contour is obtained afterward. The BRR robot cleans thoroughly the blood running out the incision. Conclusions: This study contributes the first result on designing an autonomous blood removal medical robot. The skill of the surgical blood removal operation, which is manually operated by surgeons nowadays, is alternatively grasped by the proposed BRR medical robot.    ",

        "abstract": "    Learning manipulation skills from open surgery provides more flexible access to the organ targets in the abdomen cavity and this could make the surgical robot working in a highly intelligent and friendly manner. Teaching by demonstration (TbD) is capable of transferring the manipulation skills from human to humanoid robots by employing active learning of multiple demonstrated tasks. This work aims to transfer motion skills from multiple human demonstrations in open surgery to robot manipulators in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RA-MIS) by using TbD. However, the kinematic constraint should be respected during the performing of the learned skills by using a robot for minimally invasive surgery. In this article, we propose a novel methodology by integrating the cognitive learning techniques and the developed control techniques, allowing the robot to be highly intelligent to learn senior surgeons’ skills and to perform the learned surgical operations in semiautonomous surgery in the future. Finally, experiments are performed to verify the efficiency of the proposed strategy, and the results demonstrate the ability of the system to transfer human manipulation skills to a robot in RA-MIS and also shows that the remote center of motion (RCM) constraint can be guaranteed simultaneously. Note to Practitioners —This article is inspired by limited access to the manipulation of laparoscopic surgery under a kinematic constraint at the point of incision. Current commercial surgical robots are mostly operated by teleoperation, which is representing less autonomy on surgery. Assisting and enhancing the surgeon’s performance by increasing the autonomy of surgical robots has fundamental importance. The technique of teaching by demonstration (TbD) is capable of transferring the manipulation skills from human to humanoid robots by employing active learning of multiple demonstrated tasks. With the improved ability to interact with humans, such as flexibility and compliance, the new generation of serial robots becomes more and more popular in nonclinical research. Thus, advanced control strategies are required by integrating cognitive functions and learning techniques into the processes of surgical operation between robots, surgeon, and minimally invasive surgery (MIS). In this article, we propose a novel methodology to model the manipulation skill from multiple demonstrations and execute the learned operations in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RA-MIS) by using a decoupled controller to respect the remote center of motion (RCM) constraint exploiting the redundancy of the robot. The developed control scheme has the following functionalities: 1) it enables the 3-D manipulation skill modeling after multiple demonstrations of the surgical tasks in open surgery by integrating dynamic time warping (DTW) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based dynamic movement primitive (DMP) and 2) it maintains the RCM constraint in a smaller safe area while performing the learned operation in RA-MIS. The developed control strategy can also be potentially used in other industrial applications with a similar scenario    ",

Then we provide two common and interrelated paradigms found in CIIM systems and provide a few selected examples of each paradigm. The first paradigm (which we call “surgical CAD/CAM”) emphasizes CIIM as a closed-loop process consisting of (1) constructing a patient-specific model and interventional plan; (2) registering the model and plan to the patient; (3) using technology to assist in carrying out the plan; and (4) assessing the result. The second paradigm, which we refer to as “surgical assistance,” emphasizes the interactive nature of CIIM systems, in which surgical decisions are made in the operating room.    ",

Robot-assisted surgeries offer many benefits over the conventional approach including lower risk of infection and blood loss, shorter recovery, and an overall safer procedure for patients. The past few decades have shown many emerging surgical robotic platforms that can work in complex and confined channels of the internal human organs and improve the cognitive and physical skills of the surgeons during the operation. Advanced technologies for sensing, actuation, and intelligent control have enabled multiple surgical devices to simultaneously operate within the human body at low cost and with more efficiency. Despite advances, current surgical intervention systems are not able to execute autonomous tasks and make cognitive decisions that are analogous to those of humans.

        "abstract": "    Minimally invasive surgical robots have received more and more attention from medical patients because of their higher surgical accuracy and higher safety than doctors. Minimally invasive surgery is rapidly revolutionizing the treatment of traditional surgery. In order to solve the problem that the surgical robot has a redundant degree of freedom, which makes the kinematics solution more complicated, this paper analyzes the kinematics of the coordinate system block. Aiming at the problem that the strategy search algorithm needs to re-learn when the target pose changes, a convolutional neural network control strategy is studied and constructed. By designing the structure of the convolutional neural network visual layer and motor control layer, the loss function and sampling of the training process are established. Aiming at the problem of long training time of convolutional neural network, an effective pre-training method is proposed to shorten the training time of the neural network. At the same time, the effectiveness of the above method and the end-to-end control of the convolutional neural network strategy are verified through simulation experiments. The physical structure of the manipulator body is analyzed, and the forward and inverse kinematic equations of the manipulator are established by the D-H method. Monte Carlo method was used to analyze the working space of the manipulator, and low-latency control and simulation experiments were carried out on the movement trajectory of the manipulator in joint space and Cartesian space. The results show that the low-latency control algorithm in this paper is effective to control the mechanical arm of the minimally invasive medical surgery robot.    ",

The company develops, manufactures and markets the Surgical System da Vinci, the most complex device used in medical robotics. The product is called \"da Vinci\" because Leonardo da Vinci invented the first robot, and his works excel in anatomical details. The Surgical System da Vinci is a robotic platform that allows complex surgery through incisions of 1-2 cm. So far, hundreds of thousands of surgeries have been performed. The Surgical System da Vinci reproduces the surgeon's movements in real time. The advantages of using the Surgical System da Vinci, are greater precision, a much better picture and remote surgery. The disadvantages to traditional techniques are that it cannot be programmed and cannot make decisions on its own to make a surgical move or surgery without the surgeon's command. The Surgical System da Vinci is used currently in major medical centers around the world.    ",

On the other hand, relatively high equipment costs have risks to slow down researches and mass adoption on the field. In light of this, current study represents performance evaluation of a low cost motion capture cameras on a scenario that tries to demonstrate robotic surgery like operation on a target patient through virtual navigation. Throughout the study least squares point based registration technique was utilized to correlate different reference frames with each other. A new approach was proposed for the calibration between robot manipulator and motion capture system to allow operation without using markers on manipulator side. Innovative patient mockup design with precisely formed landmark points was also introduced in order to verify performances of utilized low cost hardware. At the end of the study, hardware verification results showed the possibility of sub millimeter precisions in demonstrated navigation procedures.    ",

Methods    Clinical data of 105 patients who underwent robot-assisted spinal surgery was collected, and screw accuracy was evaluated by computed tomography according to the modified Gertzbein–Robbins classification. Patients were grouped by percutaneous and open surgery. Intergroup comparisons of clinical and screw accuracy parameters were performed. Reasons for deviation were determined. Thirty-one patients with lumbar spondylolisthesis undergoing open robot-assisted surgery and the same number of patients treated by open freehand surgery were compared for screw accuracy.    Results    Screw accuracy was not significantly different between the percutaneous and open groups in both intra- and postoperative evaluations. Tool skiving was identified as the main cause of deviation. The proportion of malpositioned screws (grade B + C + D) was significantly higher in the freehand group than in the robot-assisted group. However, remarkably malpositioned (grade C + D) screws showed no significant differences between the groups. No revision surgery was necessary.    Conclusions    Robot-assisted spinal instrumentation manifests high accuracy and low incidence of nerve injury. Tool skiving is a major cause of implant deviation.    ",

        "abstract": "    Growing robots that achieve locomotion by extending from their tip, are inherently compliant and can safely navigate through constrained environments that prove challenging for traditional robots. However, the same compliance and tip-extension mechanism that enables this ability, also leads directly to challenges in their shape estimation and control. In this letter, we present a low-cost, wireless, permanent magnet-based method for localizing the tip of these robots. A permanent magnet is placed at the robot tip, and an array of magneto-inductive sensors is used to measure the change in magnetic field as the robot moves through its workspace. We develop an approach to localization that combines analytical and machine learning techniques and show that it outperforms existing methods. We also measure the position error over a 500mm × 500 mm workspace with different magnet sizes to show that this approach can accommodate growing robots of different scales. Lastly, we show that our localization method is suitable for tracking the tip of a growing robot by deploying a 12 mm robot through different, constrained environments. Our method achieves position and orientation errors of 3.0 ± 1.1 mm and 6.5 ±5.4° in the planar case and 4.3 ± 2.3 mm, 3.9 ±3.0°, and 3.8 ±3.5° in the 5-DOF setting.    ",

Efficient energy usage is a crucial issue because energy consumption will increase with the application and expansion of robotics. The power consumption of the robot system is affected by the task and its operating environment. This paper designs a six-wheel-drive medical rescue mobile robot using a hybrid system. Aiming at the wheel driving conditions of mobile robots, a power-adaptation control strategy is proposed, and its structure and driving form is introduced. Firstly, based on a power-adaptation control strategy, a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) algorithm is proposed to optimize the power adaptive control strategy. Non-linear model predictive control uses a non-linear model to represent the medical rescue robot model and external characteristic constraints. Secondly, the AVL CRUISE module is used to build a dynamic model of a medical rescue mobile robot, and it is jointly simulated with MATLAB/Simulink to simulate the energy consumption of a medical rescue robot under Urban Driving Cycle (UDC) standard operating conditions. Finally, the NMPC method is used to solve the system and compared with the power-adaptation control strategy. The simulation results show that compared with the power adaptive control strategy, the fuel consumption of combustion engine of the NMPC is improved by 26.4 percent.    ",

Typical wearable robots mainly include exoskeletons and prostheses. However, their functions are limited due to dedicated design. In recent years, Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRLs) have become a hot spot in the field of wearable robots. Different from exoskeletons and prostheses, SRLs compensate and strengthen human abilities by providing extra limbs. This advantage allows SRLs to assist users in a novel way, rather than substituting missing limbs or enhancing existing limbs. However, finding a trade-off between wearability, efficiency, and usability of those SRLs is still an issue. This paper presents the state of the art in SRLs and discusses some open questions about SRLs’ design and control for further research. This review covers the following areas: (1) Basic concepts and classifications of SRLs; (2) The literature retrieval methodology; (3) Design functions of different types of SRLs, including their positive and negative aspects; (4) Different control strategies of SRLs, including positive and negative aspects, and some improvement methods in applying SRLs; (5) The impact on human body schema while using SRLs; (6) Open challenges and suggestions for future development. This review will help researchers understand the current state of SRLs and provide comprehensive knowledge foundations for them.    ",

        "abstract": "    The COVID-19 pandemic has changed our world and impacted multiple layers of our society. All frontline workers and in particular those in direct contact with patients have been exposed to major risk. To mitigate pathogen spread and protect healthcare workers and patients, medical services have been largely restricted, including cancellation of elective surgeries, which has posed a substantial burden for patients and immense economic loss for various hospitals. The integration of a robot as a shielding layer, physically separating the healthcare worker and patient, is a powerful tool to combat the omnipresent fear of pathogen contamination and maintain surgical volumes. In this Perspective, we outline detailed scenarios in the pre-, intra- and postoperative care, in which the use of robots and artificial intelligence can mitigate infectious contamination and aid patient management in the surgical environment during times of immense patient influx. We also discuss cost-effectiveness and benefits of surgical robotic systems beyond their use in pandemics. The current pandemic creates unprecedented demands for hospitals. Digitization and machine intelligence are gaining significance in healthcare to combat the virus. Their legacy may well outlast the pandemic and revolutionize surgical performance and management.

        "abstract": "    In this paper, a novel force/torque estimation algorithm for the in-house developed instrument in the robotic-assisted arthroscopic surgery system is proposed. This surgical robot system consists of two parts with 7 degree-of-freedom (DOF) Franka Emika robot for providing 4-DOF Remote Centre of Motion (RCM) about the incision-trocar and an instrument performing bone grinding. The method utilizes Neural Networks (NN) in the Cartesian space to estimate external forces acting on the instrument. The instrument is a rigid-link mechanism attached to the end of the Franka robot by a 6-DOF wrist force sensor. With this proposed method it is possible to obtain force and torque estimation in Cartesian space for any rigid-link wrist mechanism under RCM constraints. Several experiments are performed on an actual robotic system prototype and results show the efficacy of the proposed method.    ",

        "abstract": "    Due to the complexity of the maxillofacial surgery, the novice should be sufficiently trained before one is qualified to carry on the surgery. To reduce the training costs and improve the training efficiency, a virtual mandible surgical system with haptic feedback is proposed. This surgical simulation system offers users the haptic feedback while simulating maxillofacial surgery. An integrated model is introduced to optimize the system simulation process, which includes force output to a six-degree-of-freedom haptic device. Based on the anatomy structure of the bone tissue, a two-layer mechanism model is designed to balance the requirement of real-time response and the force feedback accuracy. Collision detection, force rendering, and grinding function are studied to simulate some essential operations: open reduction, osteotomy, and palate fixation. The proposed simulation platform can assist in the training and planning of these oral and maxillofacial surgeries. The fast response feature enables surgeons to design a patient-specific guide plate in real-time. Ten stomatology surgeons evaluated this surgical simulation system from the following four indexes: the level of immersion, user-friendliness, stability, and the effect of surgical training. The evaluation score is eight out of ten.      ",

        "abstract": "    Background    In recent years, surgical robots have become an indispensable part of the medical field. Surgical robots are increasingly being used in the areas of gynaecological surgery, urological surgery, orthopaedic surgery, general surgery and so forth. In this paper, the development of surgical robots in different operations is reviewed and analysed. In the type of master–slave surgical robotic system, the robotic surgical instrument arms were located in the execution terminal of a surgical robot system, as one of the core components, and directly contact with the patient during the operation, which plays an important role in the efficiency and safety of the operation. In clinical, the arm function and design in different systems varies. Furtherly, the current research progress of robotic surgical instrument arms used in different operations is analysed and summarised. Finally, the challenge and trend are concluded.    Methods    According to the classification of surgical types, the development of surgical robots for laparoscopic surgery, neurosurgery, orthopaedics and microsurgery are analysed and summarised. Then, focusing on the research of robotic surgical instrument arms, according to structure type, the research and application of straight-rod surgical instrument arm, joint surgical instrument arm and continuous surgical instrument arm are analysed respectively.    Results    According to the discussion and summary of the characteristics of the existing surgical robots and instrument arms, it is concluded that they still have a lot of room for development in the future. Therefore, the development trends of the surgical robot and instrument arm are discussed and analysed in the five aspects of structural materials, modularisation, telemedicine, intelligence and human–machine collaboration.    Conclusion    Surgical robots have shown the development trend of miniaturisation, intelligence, autonomy and dexterity. Thereby, in the field of science and technology, the research on the next generation of minimally invasive surgical robots will usher in a peak period of development.    ",

This article presents an accurate and efficient positioning method and robot system for percutaneous needle placement under c-arm fluoroscopy.    Methods    A simple five degree of freedom (DOF) robot with a unique end-effector is designed to perform perspective calibration and image space registration. The principle of pedicle standard axis positioning is adopted to make the axis of the pedicle overlap with the x-ray axis of c-arm.    Results    Then the clinical operation is carried out to verify the clinical feasibility of the designed robot and positioning method. The experimental results show that a total of 26 pedicle screws were accurately implanted. The accuracy of Grade A is 96.15 percent. The positioning time of a single guide pin is about 154.77 s, and three x-ray films need to be taken on average.    Conclusions    The positioning accuracy is increased by using the present method. In addition, this method is simple in operation, short in operation time, low in X-ray exposure.    ",

        "abstract": "    Force and collision control is a primary concern to guarantee the safe use of medical robots as such systems normally need to interact with clinicians and patients, while at the same time cooperate with other devices. Among different strategies, passive features working with intrinsically safety components are treated as one of the most effective approaches and therefore deserve in-depth study. In this study, we focus on the design of a novel back-drivable safety joint that incorporates a torque limiter with passive compliance and a manual override mechanism to disconnect the robotic joint from its drive train. The design and working principle of the proposed joint are explained, followed by the mathematical analysis of its performance and the impacts of parameters. An example of the design was manufactured and tested experimentally to validate the working concepts. It is concluded that the proposed multi-functional safety joint provides more versatility and customization to the design of bespoke medical robots and would limit the maximum torque that can be exserted onto the patient, allow the clinician to push the joint back, and enable the operator to switch back to manual override.
